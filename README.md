Runtime Script Inspector
======================

This tool helps developers to debug custom scripts attached to a gameobject runtime. The main reason why I wrote this is that Unity doesn't allow modification of private and protected variables although you can see them in debug mode. 

This editor shows the values of private, protected and public variables and allows them to be modified. 

In addition, it discovers the methods which don't take parameters and provides an external way to call them with a button in order to speed up test process.

I'm planning to add invocation support for methods with parameters.
