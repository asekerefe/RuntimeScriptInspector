RuntimeScriptInspector
======================

This tool helps developers to debug custom scripts attached to a gameobject runtime. It shows the values of private, protected and public variables and allows them to be modified. 

In addition, it discovers the methods which don't take parameters and provides an external way to call them with a button.
